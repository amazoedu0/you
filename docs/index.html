            <p style="text-align: center; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Lato; letter-spacing: 3px;">An
                advanced chat tool that is
                you.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Built by : Keerthana, Vivek</b> |<a
                    href="https://github.com/nuwandavek/you/tree/expertai"> GitHub Repo</a></p>
            <p class="content">We've all used GMail and it's incredibly advanced features (smart autocomplete, auto
                identification of potential links, etc.). Tools like these are so ubiquitous these days, and help in
                making a lot of our tasks easier. Some of these have trickled down to personal chats (spell checks
                etc.), but are not nearly as powerful as features available on proprietary platforms. At least nothing
                private and free. So, hundreds of thousands of small businesses that use whatsapp or other messaging
                apps to conduct business cannot use these powerful tools. Let alone billions of regular users. <br><br>
                That's what we wanted to build. a tool that seamlessly integrates into how you do business already, and
                make communication delightful!
            </p>

            <p class="jumbo2">"You" can fix this!</p>
            <p class="content">You helps individuals and small businesses improve their responses (speed and quality) to
                customers! It gives you auto-generated prompts for quick responses. It also gives you sentiment scores
                for message-threads so that you can focus on the most pressing messages - especially if the same account
                is used by multiple business owners. Finally, it auto generates calendar invite links so that you can be
                on top of all upcoming meetings and appointments. <br><br>


                The best thing? You runs locally and is completely private! You lets you train a generative model that
                can mimic your personal style, and use it as an autocompletion tool. Currently, You trains on WhatsApp
                chat history, and offers autocomplete suggestions on WhatsApp Web via a Chrome extension. This can be
                extended to train and autocomplete on more personal communication apps (Messenger, email, slack,
                Twitter). <b>You absolutely do not have to commit to any other expensive and non-private CRM app.</b>

            <p class="jumbo2">Technology & Challenges</p>
            <p>You is an MVP. Current installation steps are a bit more involved than they need to be. But we believe
                that the results are compelling enough for further development.<br>

            <ul>
                <b>Simple challenges</b> :

                <li>Local Training of a DistilGPT2 model</li>
                <li>Local Expert.ai integration</li>
                <li>Chrome/Firefox Extensions</li>
                <br>
                <b>Complex challenges</b> :
                <li>Seamless UI</li>
                <li>Calendar link feature</li>
                <li>Injecting javascript into Whatsapp Web code for interactions</li>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                You is completely private and secure, which is important to us. We're very excited about these and more
                features expertai enables us to add. It seamlessly integrates into widely used existing apps, which is
                great. We believe that a tool like You can be extremely useful to people. It can make personal
                communication delightful, and business communication efficient and productive.
